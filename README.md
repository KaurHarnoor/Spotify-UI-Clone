# spotify_ui_clone

This is a frontend project, a clone of the Spotify user interface built using Flutter. The aim is to replicate the look and feel of the popular music streaming app for my personal use on a Windows PC. In upcoming months, I plan to also incorporate backend and make this app fully functional for my personal use.
